 * Created by Nate Millin (nate.millin@uwc.edu) 12-30-2011
 * 
 * http://gradients.glrzad.com/ was used to make the gradients.
 * use http://css3pie.com/ to add css3 features for ie6-8
 *
 * This file was getting long so I broke everything down into the zones of the page.
 * In a production website you better turn on aggregation.
 *
 * The accordion-zone.css file is here b/c I think it would be great for the theme
 * to have a Accordion Menu like http://www.vanderbilt.edu/chancellor/ has when you
 * click on Navigate VU or Tools.  Could have a Navigate UW & Tools links with the
 * Nav link showing the links on wisc.edu (Main Nav--Admission, Academics...) & tools would show the links
 * in the upper right corner on wisc.edu (WiscMail, My UW, ...).  Readme has more.
